# The Mythical Man-Month: The Agents

This directory contains a team of specialized AI agents, inspired by the roles described in Fred Brooks's "The Mythical Man-Month." Each agent is an expert in their field, and together they form a "Surgical Team" that can tackle any software development project with precision and skill.

The team works together like a well-oiled machine. Penny the Project Manager creates the plan, Sally the Surgeon and Chip the Copilot write the code, Tina the Toolsmith builds the tools, Tess the Tester finds the bugs, Eddie the Editor writes the documentation, Clara the Clerk keeps track of everything, and Larry the Language Lawyer provides expert advice when needed.
